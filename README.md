## Run Locally

We need to install node.js version 14.16.1
We can also use nvm-windows (Node Version Manager) to switch between node versions

```bash
# Set node version
$ nvm use v14.16.1

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/blessssing/landx.git

# Go to the project directory
$ cd landx

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Runs the app in the development mode
$ gulp

# Builds the app for production
$ gulp build
```
